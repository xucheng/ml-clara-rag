Settlement of Deposit Products\n\n1）If Opening Account is not selected: After a user purchases a deposit product, OwnBank must settle the corresponding funds to the partner's account.\n\n2）If Opening Account is selected: After a user purchases a deposit product, no fund settlement occurs.\n\n1. Settlement of Loan Products\n\n1）If Opening Account is not selected: After a user's loan is approved, OwnBank deducts the funds from the partner's account in real-time and disburses them to the user's OwnBank account.\n\n2）If Opening Account is selected: After a user's loan is approved, no fund settlement occurs.\n\n4.Fund Changes in the Partner's User Accounts\n\n1）If Opening Account is selected:\n\na) When the user's account receives funds (cash In, received transfer), OwnBank must settle the corresponding funds to the partner's account.\n\nb) When the user's account withdraws funds (transfer, send cash, cash out, payment), OwnBank deducts the funds from the partner's account in real-time.\n\n2）If Opening Account is not selected:\n\nWhen there are fund changes in the user's account, no fund settlement occurs.\n\n5.Settlement of User Transaction Fees, OwnBank Service Fees, and Partner Revenue Sharing Fees For loan products, after each loan is approved, OwnBank deducts the loan's service fee in real-time from the partner's account.\n\n1）If Opening Account is not selected:\n\na) No transaction fee settlement occurs.\n\nb) No partner revenue sharing fee settlement occurs.\n\nc) At the end of each day, OwnBank deducts a portion from the funds deposited that day (including the partner's Pots and Time Deposits).\n\n2）If Opening Account is selected:\n\na) The fees generated from each user's transaction (user fee - OwnBank service fee) are settled to the partner's account.\n\nb) The revenue sharing fees generated from each user's transaction are settled in real-time to the partner's account.\n\nc) At the end of each day, OwnBank deducts a portion from the funds deposited that day (including the balances in the user's bank account held with the partner, Pots, and Time Deposits).\n\n1. **Risk &amp; Security**\n\nThere are several scenarios where we will do anti-fraud strategy and security enhancement.\n\n**4.1.1 Risk control &amp; Anti-Fraud**\n\n**Scenarios:Open an account**\n\nIf a customer registers an account in the ownbank system, the account opening will require the customer to complete KYC authentication. The system has a component with face recognition function, and will determine whether the current registered account is software registration or personal registration. If the account is not opened by myself, the registration will be rejected.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSecurity components provide the ability to block illegal users by rules based on rule engine and models based on machine learning and artificial intelligence althgithom.The key components are listed below:\n\n●  \tLiveness detection\n\n●  \tSlider detection\n\n●  \tOTP One Time Password\n\nAfter ownbank deploys the security components of the risk control system, it has security capabilities such as real person verification, can detect abnormal user behavior, whether the device operating environment is normal, and prevent brushing, and intercept customer behavior according to different security policies.\n\nThe ownbank system can access the security verification component to protect our customers and verify whether they operate by themselves. The security verification component has different levels such as graphic verification code, SMS verification code, last four digits of ID card, face authentication, password, and security question and answer. verification function. The security verification component changes according to the policies triggered by customers in different scenarios.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Scenarios:Transfer\n\nTransfer includes inner-bank transfer and inter-bank transfer. The risk in this scenario is the risk of loss of funds, and the strategies for risk control involved in this scenario are as follows:\n\n●      The user's PIN must be verified when submitting a transfer request. If the PIN is incorrect on multiple attempts, the PIN will be locked for 24 hours and cannot be retried.\n\n●       Face verification required for PIN change\n\n#### Scenarios:Withdraw\n\nCash withdrawal includes offline cash withdrawal and remittance, the risk in this scenario is the risk of loss of funds, strategies for risk control involved in this scenario are as follows:\n\n●     To submit a cash withdrawal application, the user's PIN must be verified. If the PIN is incorrect in multiple attempts, the PIN will be locked for 24 hours and cannot be retried.\n\n●  Face verification required for PIN change\n\n●   Withdrawal information such as recipient's name, mobile number etc. will be displayed as ***\n\nWe are now also working on more scenarios based anti-fraud strategy which can protect our users on ownbank APP.The key strategies which we are now working on and will continue work on are listed below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### 4.1.2  Security services for cyber attacks\n\nSecurity services also provide the ability to prevent cyber attacks.Risks and mitigation strategies are listed below:\n\n●  \tPhishing\n\n○      Ownbank's mailbox will detect phishing emails, find and block malicious files and phishing website links in emails.\n\n○      The employee computers of ownbank will be installed with antivirus software. If the employee's computer is attacked by phishing, malware or malicious links are opened, the background of the anti-virus software can see the blocking situation.\n\n○     The ownbank information security team regularly conducts information security training and education for employees, telling employees not to click on unknown emails and execute documents from unknown sources. Ownbank's information security team regularly conducts internal blue army drills, imitating cybercriminals to send phishing emails or Trojan horse viruses to employees, to test the security protection capability of phishing attacks, and to check employees' information security awareness.\n\n●  Remote work\n\n○      Laptops of ownbank employees need to install data leakage prevention software to access the VPN to access the internal system. The data leakage prevention software will block users' sensitive data from being sent out through the Internet, prohibit data copying to mobile hard disks, and employees' office computers will require access to the domain controller , the computer password is forced to be changed regularly.\n\n○      Ownbank has deployed data leakage prevention software forcepoint dlp, which can monitor and intercept sensitive data leakage behaviors on employees' computers, such as copying ownbank's sensitive data to a mobile hard drive, or sending sensitive data through whatsapp.\n\n○      When employees work from home, their VPN account login status will be monitored. If the account logs in from different places, does not log in through a device, or fails to log in too many times, a security alarm will be triggered to determine that the employee account or computer is being used by criminals. In addition, data leakage prevention tools block them from copying ownbank's sensitive data.\n\n●  Malware and ransomware\n\n○      Anti-virus software can block software containing virus Trojans and rogue software. If there is a CVE of major loopholes, employees will be required to install system patches.\n\n○      In addition to requiring employees to install AsiaInfo anti-virus software to prevent ransomware attacks, it also regularly conducts information security awareness training for employees, reminding employees to update security patches regularly, not to open malicious software of unknown sources at will, formulate emergency plans and regular security drills. In the event of a cyber attack, the information security team can be contacted in time.\n\n●  Spoofing\n\n○      The information security team of ownbank will regularly scan the Internet for high imitation domain names to check whether the high imitation domain name is a phishing website. If it is a phishing website, the information security team will complain to the domain name provider for the illegal website.\n\n○      If the account of an employee or customer is stolen, the ownbank system will also access the security verification component to check whether the device logged in with the account is a commonly used device. If it is not a commonly used device, different security components, such as face recognition, SMS verification code, etc will be triggered.\n\n○      After the security verification component of the risk control system is used to protect our customer account from being stolen, key operations such as password modification, mobile phone number modification, and transfer cannot be performed to ensure the security of customer accounts and funds.\n\n○      Prompt employees or customers not to visit phishing websites and enter sensitive information such as personal account passwords and ID numbers through security awareness education. And when sending SMS verification codes to employees or customers, the SMS content adds a prompt \"Don't give the verification code to others easily.\"\n\nWe are working on more security standards and systems building in the next few years,including:\n\n●  \tISO 27001 security system establishment and certification\n\n●  \tDeployment and use of SIEM\n\n●  \tBackground deployment and use of risk control case management\n\n●  \tData encryption and transformation\n\n●  \tPentest security test\n\n### 4.2  Effectiveness Platform\n\nUse technology to optimize R&amp;D efficiency, improve R&amp;D quality, and reduce R&amp;D resources investment. In order to achieve this goal, we need to make technical attempts from the following aspects.\n\n#### 4.2.1   Cross-end\n\nWe will try to use cross-end technical solutions, such as Flutter, ReactNative and Mini Program.\n\nThrough the application of these technologies, we will reduce the labor cost of iOS and Android, and use a cross-end technical talent to meet the research and development requirements of the two platforms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTechnical Skills, Flutter, React, ReactNative, WXML.\n\n#### 4.2.2  LowCode Platform\n\nThe low-code platform technology can greatly reduce the R&amp;D cost of our operation activities which allow the operation to quickly configure the operation activities.\n\nSecondly, in the management system that can support the internal platform, R&amp;D personnel can quickly configure an internal management configuration interface, thereby effectively reducing the dependence on front-end R&amp;D resources.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTechnical Skills, Low-code implementation, we will do some research on these technologies in the future, such as **React, Mobx, Rust &amp; WASM, DSL.**\n\n#### 4.2.3  Automated test platform\n\nIn order to reduce test resources, the core process can be quickly verified to ensure the online security of the core process.\n\nThis part of the technology includes:\n\n●  \tAutomated UI testing\n\n●  \tAutomated data reporting test\n\n●  \tAutomated testing of background interfaces\n\n●  \tAutomated dial testing of background interfaces\n\n●  \tAutomated stress testing of background interfaces Technical Skills, **Python, Pytest, Request,** Appium, Jmeter.\n\n### 4.3  Micro Service\n\n**4.3.1  design and implement the Micro Services Architecture technology base**\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.     Container is responsible for launching, loading, and running the service Provider.\n\n2.     Provider registers its services to Register at the time it starts.\n\n3.     Consumer subscribes the services it needs from the Register when it starts.\n\n4.     Register returns the Providers list to Consumer, when it changes, the Register will push the changed data to Consumer through long connection.\n\n5.     Consumer selects one of the Providers based on soft load balancing algorithm and executes the invocation, if fails, it will choose another Provider.\n\nthe key features of micro service framework includes but not limited to\n\n1.     the core features of micro service framework include Robustness:\n\n●  \tWhen the DB server goes down, Register can return service Providers list to Consumer by checking its cache, but new Provider cannot register any services\n\n●      Register is a peer cluster, it will automatically switch to another when any instance goes down\n\n●      Even all Register’s instances go down, Provider and Consumer can still communicate by checking their local cache\n\n●      Register is aware of the existence of Provider through the long connection, when Provider gets down, Register will push the event to Consumer\n\n●  \tService Providers are stateless, one instance’s downtime doesn’t affect the usage\n\n●      After all the Providers of one service go down, Consumer can not use that service, and infinitely reconnect to wait for service Provider to recover\n\nScalability:\n\n●      Register is a peer cluster that can dynamically increase its instances, all clients will automatically discover the new instances.\n\n●      Provider is stateless, it can dynamically increase the deployment instances, and the registry will push the new service provider information to the Consumer.\n\n2.     offers a number of balancing strategies for cluster load balancing, including\n\n●  \trandom strategy:set random probabilities by weight\n\n●  \tround robin strategy: use the weight’s common advisor to determine round robin ratio\n\n●      leastactive strategy: a random mechanism based on actives, actives means the number of requests a consumer have sent but not return yet\n\n●  \tconsistentHash strategy: the same parameters of the request is always sent to the same provider\n\n3.     offers a variety of fault-tolerant scenarios when a cluster call fails, including\n\n●      failover:failure automatically switches, when there is failure, retry the other server (default). Usually used for read operations, but retries can result in longer delays\n\n●      failfast:Fast failure, only made a call, failure immediately error. Usually used for non-idempotent write operations, such as adding records\n\n●  \tfailsafe:Failure of security, anomalies, directly ignored. Usually used to write audit logs and other operations.\n\n●      failback:Failure automatically restored, failed to record the background request, regular retransmission. Usually used for message notification operations.\n\n●      Broadcast:Calling all providers broadcast, one by one call, any error is reported . It is usually used to notify all providers to update local resource information such as caches or logs.\n\n4.     delay publish, if your services need time to warm up, such as: initialization cache or another reference resource has to be ready. You can use the delay feature to delay publishing services. We fine-tuned the service delay exposure logic, delaying the countdown of services that require delayed exposure until Spring initialization is complete.\n\n5.     you can temporarily shield a non-critical service through the service downgrade and define the return policy for it.\n\n6.     graceful shutdown service without losing data Service provider\n\n●  \tWhen stopped, first marked as not receiving new requests, the new request directly returns the error, so that the client retries other machines.\n\n●      Then check if the thread pool thread is running, if any, waiting for all threads to complete execution, unless overtime, then forced to close.\n\nService consumer\n\n●  \tWhen stopped, No longer initiates a new request, all requests on the client that got an error.\n\n●  \tThen check if the request has not returned the response, waiting for the response to return, unless overtime, then forced to close.\n\n#### 4.3.2  service and data split\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 4.4  devops\n\n#### 4.4.1  Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment\n\nIn order to efficiently fulfill the business requirements, we need a set of tools and workflow specifications to support organizations to coordinate with each other better. all roles including productor、developer、are、oa kown their position in the entire flow, also known what to do to help other role’s work can be done without block\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### 4.4.2  monitor and alert\n\nAfter the business requirement is implemented and deployed to the product environment, we need a set of monitor and alert systems to help us check the running status of all service/server.\n\n●      single node monitor system with help of single node monitor system , we can collect all running status data including os layer, base component layer, service framework and business server layer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n●      call chain monitor system, As the business becomes prosperous, the micro services of business become more and more , the difficulty of system maintenance also rises quickly. at this time ,we need a call chain monitor system to help us.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### 4.4.3  cloud native\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKey features of Cloud Native Devops:\n\n●        Containerization &amp; Docker Hub\n\n●  \tContainer Orchestration Platform, Kubernete(K8S)\n\n●  \tSecurity Scanning component\n\n●  \tKMS Key Management Server\n\n4.5  Data Platform\n\n#### 4.5.1  Data Security &amp; Data access Management\n\n**Auditing and Sensitive Data Encryption**\n\nReview and control of database operation and maintenance behaviors through the operation and maintenance management system, and the sensitive data is deformed, encrypted, or converted into fictitious data;\n\nThrough the audit system, the operation behavior of the database is monitored to provide accurate traceability for the post-determination of responsibility for the safety of everything.\n\n**Access Management**\n\nThe RBAC model will control the permissions of users by defining the permissions of roles and granting certain roles to users, thus realizing the logical separation of users and permissions. It simplifies the relationship between users and permissions, and is easy to expand and maintain. Divide the roles of accessing data into:\n\n●  \tAdministrator\n\n●  \tEditor (read/write)\n\n●  \tVisitor (read only for specific datas of his/her roles)\n\nThen assign different Permissions based on different Roles. All permission applications and authorization processes will be strictly recorded.\n\n**Least privilege &amp; Privilege expiration**\n\nAll data permissions are granted in accordance with the principle of least permission, and the permission expiration time will be set to strictly control the granularity of data access.\n\nThe above functions are implemented by the data rights management system.\n\n#### 4.5.2  Data modeling &amp; Data Applications\n\nThe application, flexible query, and data analysis built on the big data platform support business development.\n\nConstruction provides a **unified big data service** , summarizes the model construction methodology applicable to the characteristics of banking business, and provides a solid data foundation for **data analysis, data mining and other data services** .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccording to different functional divisions, realize unified storage and partition organization of various models, conduct research and analysis on core trading systems, and plan data analysis applications for\n\n● **Deposits, Loans**\n\n● **Contracts**\n\n● **Institutions**\n\n● **Customers**\n\n● **Transaction details**\n\n● **Reporting systems**\n\nservice support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCentralized data processing is carried out through the data warehouse, strong relevant information is filtered out, basic tags and application customization are carried out by using the tagging system, and target customer selection or in-depth analysis of users is carried out according to the needs of business scenarios. Improve the design of data scenarios, improve the accuracy of target customers, conduct marketing to customers, and give feedback on marketing effects to measure the commercial value of data products.\n\nThrough the data collection and label construction of online channels such as mobile banking APP and online banking (including customer **activity data, search, browsing, purchase, payment, activity participation** , etc.), a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of customer needs can be achieved.\n\n#### 4.5.3  Data Platform infrastructures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n**Batch computing and intelligent data analysis**\n\nUse Hadoop, Hive, Spark and other technologies to realize massive offline data computing, and provide T+1 data support for business;\n\n**Real-time computing accelerates business decisions**\n\nIntegrate the modern data technology stack, use Flink, Kafka and other stream processing tools to complete the ingestion and calculation of real-time data, and provide more accurate data results for business in scenarios such as risk control and credit granting;\n\n**Data-lake and Warehouse integration**\n\nBreaking the split system between the data lake and the data warehouse, the architecture integrates the flexibility and ecological richness of the data lake with the enterprise-level capabilities of the data warehouse, and builds a data management platform that integrates the data lake and the data warehouse.\n\nAn enterprise-level high-performance data warehouse that meets the needs of high business elasticity and agility at a lower cost through cloud-native big data services.\n\nElastic computing &amp; Cloud-Native\n\nBy integrating with cloud-native capabilities, computing resources can be easily scaled up and down to cope with frequently changing business traffic and refined control of server costs.\n\n### 4.6  Cloud &amp; Hybird\n\nOwnbank IAAS layer is based on a hybrid architecture which takes advantage of both public cloud and private cloud.The key benefits of hybrid cloud are listed below:\n\n●      Public cloud can provide flexible elasticity for servers,databases,message queues and other infrastructure services.\n\n●      Private cloud can protect users' privacy by an on-premises data center. Security and governance can be followed based on local data storage policies and laws.\n\n●  \tAn adequate network connection between private and public cloud environments.\n\n#### 4.6.1  Aliyun Cloud &amp; Huawei Cloud\n\nOwnbank chose Aliyun as the public cloud service provider. Aliyun provides several key features.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAliyun provides a 7x24 on-call duty for our cloud services which guarantee our needs on online issues.A powerful public cloud infrastructure can meet the continuous rapid growth of business, allowing business to take advantage of cloud bursting to free up more space and scale computing services to the public cloud when computing demand increases.\n\nOwnbank chose Huawei as the private cloud provider.Huawei provides several key features.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHuawei promised a SLA agreement for the on-premises data center of ownbank.And by virtualization solution, our staff can work on the private cloud using the almost same software stack\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### 4.6.2  Unified Hybrid Platform\n\nOwnbank is starting to coalesce around a unified hybrid multi-cloud platform that includes:\n\n●     Support for cloud-native application development and deployment across all cloud types (public and private) and cloud providers\n\n●  A single operating system across all environments\n\n●     A container orchestration platform - typically Kubernetes - that automates the deployment of applications across cloud environments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAn ideally sample diagram showing our multi-cloud platform architecture under planning.\n\n1. **System architecture and framework**\n\n5.1Base Technology Framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe diagram above represents the security technology framework of the OwnBank banking system, which incorporates several security technologies including Cloud Firewall, SandBoxed, VPC, Anti-DDoS, and others.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthis diagram show almost all the key business module of ownbank without the base technology platform\n\n**5.2Disaster recover operation over  zone**\n\nthe ownbank business system is deployed in two zone , ervery zone has  a set of all systems, include api-gateway、business-logic-server、 base-service-server、base technology platform; two zone share the same data storage,and the buniness  data will backup over zone automatic；if the main zone breakdown, we can use dns and slb to\n\nroute custom's request to backup zone in not more than five minutes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin one zone, our it systme may be divided into 6 layers,  every layer has its own disaster recover solution and operation plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n**5.3 Disaster recover operation plan between app and waf**\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf the WAF access fails, you can use domain name resolution to switch.Services are expected to be affected for five minutes without data loss\n\n5.4 Disaster recover solution of alibaba cloud mysql cluster\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n**5.5 Disaster recover solution of tdsql**\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.core system data is divided into two set, and stored in two different store set\n\n2.proxy will regis its own running status to zookeeper periodicity\n\n3.agent will regis its partner mysql running status to zookeeper periodicity\n\n4.base service server send sql request to proxy cluster , proxy parse sql content and route the request to correct set's master mysql\n\n5.when master node in set breakdown,  slave node in the same set  will become new master node and work on ,all this process  is control by scheduler automation\n\n**5.6 disaster recover plan of tdsql**\n\n**Distributed High Availability**\n\nA distributed architecture itself boasts a very high availability, that is, any failure of a single node does not affect\n\nthe overall availability of the cluster. On this basis, TDSQL further configures master-slave redundancy for each\n\nshard to ensure constant high availability for your business.\n\n**Automatic Node Failure Recovery**\n\nWhen a physical node carrying shards fails, the scheduling system will automatically retry to recover the node.\n\nIf the original node cannot be recovered, it will automatically apply for new resources within 30 minutes,\n\nrebuild the node from backups, and automatically add the node to the cluster to ensure long term functionality\n\nof the master-slave switchover of the shards.\n\n**Finance-grade Disaster Recovery**\n\nTDSQL can provide a 1-region-2-DC or 2-region-3-DC deployment architecture. When a failure occurs,\n\nthe database can be restored to its normal condition in a matter of minutes.\n\n--- Extracted Images ---\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_0.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_1.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_2.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_3.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_4.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_5.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_6.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_7.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_8.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_9.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_10.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_11.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_12.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_13.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_14.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_15.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_16.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_17.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_18.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_19.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_20.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_21.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_22.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_23.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_24.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_25.png]\n", "product_area": "Product Manual", "extracted_images": ["example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_0.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_1.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_2.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_3.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_4.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_5.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_6.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_7.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_8.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_9.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_10.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_11.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_12.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_13.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_14.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_15.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_16.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_17.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_18.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_19.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_20.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_21.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_22.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_23.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_24.png", "example/extracted_assets/Cooperation Content Draft_img_25.png"]}

Payroll Data Preparation: The company's HR or Finance Department is responsible for collecting and processing employees' payroll data. This includes information such as employees' basic wages, overtime hours, leave records, pre-tax deductions, etc.\n2. Salary Calculation: Based on the employees' work circumstances and contractual agreements, the company calculates the payable salary for each employee. Payroll calculation takes into account factors such as overtime pay, performance bonus, tax deduction, etc.\n3. Tax Processing: In the Philippines, employee salary is generally subject to tax withholding. Companies must calculate and withhold income tax and other relevant taxes from each employee's salary in accordance with the Philippines tax regulations.\n4.

This includes information such as employees' basic wages, overtime hours, leave records, pre-tax deductions, etc.\n2.

Payroll calculation takes into account factors such as overtime pay, performance bonus, tax deduction, etc.\n3.

Companies must calculate and withhold income tax and other relevant taxes from each employee's salary in accordance with the Philippines tax regulations.\n4.

Upon approval, a credit limit is granted. Note that this credit approval process will be linked with the credit card limit, allowing the user to obtain two credit limits through a single application—one for the cash loan and one for the credit card. Typically, the cash loan limit equals the credit card limit plus an additional credit line.\n\n2.Withdrawal Process:\n\nThe user can withdraw funds at any time within the approved credit limit. The withdrawn amount will be instantly credited to the Own Wallet account, anytime and anywhere.\n\n3. Repayment Process:\n\nAfter the withdrawal process, the user is required to make timely repayments according to the repayment schedule specified by the bank. Early repayment is also supported; however, the user is still required to pay interest as outlined in the repayment plan.Various repayment methods are supported, including equal principal payments, equal installment payments (principal and interest), and flexible repayment (borrow and repay anytime).\n\n4. Post-Loan Management:\n\nIf the user fails to make repayments on time, the loan will be considered overdue. In such cases, penalty interest will be charged.\n\n# Key product features \n\n- End-to-end process flow (from application to repayment)\n- Involved teams and handoffs \n- Required technology integration and testing\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l5CKFlNzmDk3trdTeRGCxAa5z-hvncZP?ths=true \n\nIntegrated with CIC, 64AI, and Trust Social.\n\n# Product Implementation Workflow\n\n--- Extracted Images ---\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Loan_img_0.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Loan_img_1.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Loan_img_2.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Loan_img_3.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Loan_img_4.png]\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Loan_img_5.png]\n", "product_area": "Loan", "extracted_images": ["example/extracted_assets/Loan_img_0.png", "example/extracted_assets/Loan_img_1.png", "example/extracted_assets/Loan_img_2.png", "example/extracted_assets/Loan_img_3.png", "example/extracted_assets/Loan_img_4.png", "example/extracted_assets/Loan_img_5.png"]}

Users can apply for a physical debit or credit card from OwnBank according to their own needs. Once an application is approved by OwnBank, the card could either be mailed to the mailing address provided by the user or collected at an OwnBank branch.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n# Introduction to Types of OwnBank Card \n\nDebit Card  (Physical Card / Virtual Card)\n\n- When there are available funds in OwnBasic Account (SA/CA), they can be withdrawn or used to pay for shopping expenses.\n- When there are no available funds in OwnBasic Account, the credit limit can be used to withdraw cash or pay for shopping expenses.\n- OwnBank \"Debit and Credit All-in-One Card\" Mastercard is a single card that combines the features of debit and credit cards, prioritizing the use of OwnBank's credit limit (Credit Account) for cash withdrawals or shopping expenses. When the limit is insufficient, the available funds in the account can be used for payments. The balance in OwnBasic Account can be used for cash withdrawals, fund transfers, and other transactions.\n\nCredit Card   (Physical Card / Virtual Card)\n\n\"Debit and Credit All-in-One Card\"  (Physical Card / Virtual Card)\n\n# OwnBank Debit Card\n\n1. User has an OwnBank account. OwnBank will assign a virtual debit card to the user by default.\n2. User activates the card prior to its normal usage.\n\nDebit Card Features:\n\nCard issuance requirements:\n\n1. Deposit and withdrawal.\n2. The balance is linked to OwnBasic Account.\n3. Supports online/offline POS spending.\n\n# Introduction to OwnBank Card Upgrade Process\n\n1. After activating the default virtual debit card, user could upgrade to a virtual credit card or a virtual all-in-one card by providing additional KYC information.\n2. Users with virtual debit card and virtual credit /virtual all-in-one card can apply for physical card.\n3. The virtual debit card of a user who applies for a physical card can remain in use with no need for replacement after the user completes the information for an upgrade to a credit or all-in-one card.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n# KYC Process for Debit Card Upgrade to Credit/All-in-One Card\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTips: After a successful upgrade, a credit account which automatically links its user’s all-in-one / credit card will be opened.\n\n# Appendix: Process for Basic Account Upgrade to Full Account\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTips: When a user with a Basic Account clicks the “Upgrade” button for a debit card upgrade to credit/all-in-one card, the user needs an upgrade to Full Account before resuming the card upgrade process.\n\n# Differences between OwnBank's All-in-One card and Debit/Credit Card\n\nAll-In-One Card: \n\n1. The credit limit will be used first for spending. \n2. User deposit and interbank transfer-in will go into OwnBasic Account. \n3. At an ATM cash withdrawal, the fund will first be withdrawn from OwnBasic Account. If the withdrawal amount exceeds the balance in the OwnBasic Account, the insufficient amount will be withdrawn from the credit limit. \n4. Due date repayment will be automatically debited from the user’s OwnBasic Account. The user also has the option of manual repayment.\n\n# Billing and Repayment for Credit/All-in-One Card\n\n1. Each billing statement is generated based on the summarization at a set date each month of the payments made in a set period.\n2. Two bill repayment methods are supported: minimum payment and full payment.\n3. Billing cycle: calculated from one day after a billing date to the next billing date.\n4. Billing amount：\n5. The repayment date settings: the period between the time the bill is generated and the next billing date.\n6. Minimum repayment amount: \n\n   Total amount of the current bill = total spend in the current bill + outstanding balance from the previous bill + penalty + interest.\n\n                     \n\nOutstanding amount from the previous bill = previous bill amount - the amount paid during the current billing cycle.\n\nThe minimum payment is the minimum repayment amount needed in a billing period to change its billing status to \"paid\".\n\n        \n\nMinimum payment = a certain percentage of the outstanding balance within the credit limit on the current billing statement + outstanding balance from previous bill + late fee + interest.\n\n# Formula for interest and penalty calculations\n\nInterest and Penalty Calculations \n\n1. Interest Calculation: \n\nIf a credit card is repaid within the interest-free period, no interest will be charged. After the due date, interest will be calculated on a daily basis at a certain interest rate per spending in the current month as the principal, from the day of spending until the entire balance is paid.\n\nInterest per transaction = Single transaction amount × number of days × interest rate.\n\nThe total transaction interest = Sum of the interest on all single transactions.\n\n2. Penalty Collection Requirements：\n\nIf the amount paid before the due date (included) is greater than or equal to the minimum payment amount, it will not be considered as overdue. If the payment amount is less than the minimum payment amount, a penalty will be charged.\n\n3. The accrued interest and penalty will be included in the next bill.\n\n# Card Risk Control\n\n1. The card cannot be transferred or lent to others for use.\n2. The cardholder can decide to suspend, report loss, or cancel the card and its rights at any time and for any reason.\n3. The cardholder's account can only be closed after all fees and outstanding debts incurred by the card usage are fully paid.\n4. The balance of the cardholder's OwnBasic Account should be used to settle all fees and outstanding debts incurred by the card usage, and the cardholder should compensate the bank for all fees (including legal fees) and expenses incurred by the bank in recovering these funds.\n5. The bank may freeze or terminate the card account and its rights, as well as all supplementary cards, without prior notice to the cardholder, in the event of, including but not limited to, arrears, default, false statement, fraudulent use, and other similar conditions. In this case, the cardholder shall immediately fully settle the outstanding debts. Only after the cardholder's debts are fully paid, the cardholder's card account can be deemed closed. In the event of cardholder card account termination, the bank will not refund any portion of the membership fee or any portion thereof to the cardholder.\n6. If the card is lost or stolen, the cardholder should immediately report the loss to the bank to block the card. If the card is used for fraudulent purposes, the lost card protection feature can relieve the cardholder of any financial liability, but only from the time of loss report to the bank.\n7. The cardholder can apply to the bank for a lost card replacement. After reissuing, the bank will send the card to the address provided by the user. The user can also opt for pick up at a bank branch.\n\n# Customer Service &amp; Complaint\n\nHelp &amp; Support\n\nUsers can resolve encountered issues through the following methods.\n\n1.

Account opening\n\n2. Deposits and withdrawals\n\n3. Transfers\n\n4. Passbook services\n\n5. Loans\n\n6. Paying bills.\n\n# Exo Swap - New Icore for new user\n\n①Account openning\n\n1. 如果线下用户过来开户，我们优先引导用户下载own bank app. 自己完成开户操作。我们可以在网点粘贴二维码或者有专门的人指引用户完成app下载并协助用户完成开户\n\nIf offline users come in for account opening, we prioritize guiding them to download our own bank app and complete the account opening process themselves.We can either display QR codes at the branch for users to scan or assign dedicated staff to guide users through the app download process and assist them in completing the account opening.\n\n2. 如果用户没有智能手机或电子设置，我们可以提供机器（比如专用手机或者ipad），让用户在机器上完成开户操作。\n\nIf users do not have a smartphone or electronic device, we can provide machines (such as dedicated phones or iPads) for users to complete the account opening process on-site.\n\n3. 如果用户在网点完成开户，网点的同事可以建群直接让风控kyc审核优先审核。用户可以当场比较短的时间完成开户操作\n\nIf a user completes the account opening process at the branch, colleagues at the branch can create a group to facilitate priority KYC review by the risk control team. This enables users to complete the account opening process in a relatively short amount of time on the spot.\n\n# Exo Swap - New Icore for new user\n\n②Deposits 、withdrawals and Transfers\n\n方案一：用户完成开户后，在网点提供的机具上完成cash in或者cash out的操作。生成订单，获得ref no.然后去附近的合作网点完成存款或者取款。\n\nOption 1: After users complete the account opening, they can use the provided terminals at the branch to perform cash-in or cash-out transactions. This generates an order, obtains a Ref No, and then the user can go to a nearby partnered branch to complete the deposit or withdrawal.\n\n方案二：我们仍需搭建现金管理系统，用户存取款通过系统完成操作。\n\nOption 2: We still need to establish a cash management system, and users can perform deposit and withdrawal transactions through the system.\n\n问题：但当前一个月仍然有10个用户使用支票存款，sherryll建议还是保留存折存款的功能。\n\nQuestion: However, there are still 10 users using check deposits this month. Sherryll suggests retaining the option for passbook deposits.\n\n# Exo Swap - New Icore for new user\n\n③Passbook services\n\n1. 原先passbook可以让用户随时看到自己当前账户的余额及交易记录，后续我们计划所有的用户线上化。不发行存折了。\n\nInitially, the passbook allowed users to view their current account balance and transaction history at any time. However, in the future, we plan to transition all users to online services and discontinue the issuance of passbooks.\n\n2. 用户想要查询交易流水或余额时，我们提供终端设备供用户登录查询。如果用户需要纸质版的交易流水，我们也提供打印服务。\n\nWhen users wish to check their transaction history or account balance, we provide terminals for them to log in and access the information. If users prefer a physical copy of their transaction history, we offer a printing service.\n\n# Exo Swap - New Icore for new user\n\n④Loan\n\n1. 贷款申请:当前app还不支持贷款功能，因此贷款功能需要新建纸件系统。用户线下填写资料，线下完成kyc审核并发放。Icore系统录入用户贷款借据数据\n\nLoan Application: The current app does not yet support loan functionality, so  new icore system is required for loan processing.

Account opening\n\n2. Deposits and withdrawals\n\n3. Transfers\n\n4. Passbook services\n\n5. Loans\n\n6. Paying bills.\n\n# Exo Swap - New Icore for new user\n\n①Account openning\n\n1. 如果线下用户过来开户，我们优先引导用户下载own bank app. 自己完成开户操作。我们可以在网点粘贴二维码或者有专门的人指引用户完成app下载并协助用户完成开户\n\nIf offline users come in for account opening, we prioritize guiding them to download our own bank app and complete the account opening process themselves.We can either display QR codes at the branch for users to scan or assign dedicated staff to guide users through the app download process and assist them in completing the account opening.\n\n2. 如果用户没有智能手机或电子设置，我们可以提供机器（比如专用手机或者ipad），让用户在机器上完成开户操作。\n\nIf users do not have a smartphone or electronic device, we can provide machines (such as dedicated phones or iPads) for users to complete the account opening process on-site.\n\n3. 如果用户在网点完成开户，网点的同事可以建群直接让风控kyc审核优先审核。用户可以当场比较短的时间完成开户操作\n\nIf a user completes the account opening process at the branch, colleagues at the branch can create a group to facilitate priority KYC review by the risk control team. This enables users to complete the account opening process in a relatively short amount of time on the spot.\n\n?\n\n# Exo Swap - New Icore for new user\n\n②Deposits 、withdrawals and Transfers\n\n方案一：用户完成开户后，在网点提供的机具上完成cash in或者cash out的操作。生成订单，获得ref no.然后去附近的合作网点完成存款或者取款。\n\nOption 1: After users complete the account opening, they can use the provided terminals at the branch to perform cash-in or cash-out transactions. This generates an order, obtains a Ref No, and then the user can go to a nearby partnered branch to complete the deposit or withdrawal.\n\n方案二：我们仍需搭建现金管理系统，用户存取款通过系统完成操作\n\nOption 2: We still need to establish a cash management system, and users can perform deposit and withdrawal transactions through the system.\n\n# Exo Swap - New Icore for new user\n\n③Passbook services\n\n1. 原先passbook可以让用户随时看到自己当前账户的余额及交易记录，后续我们计划所有的用户线上化。不发行存折了。\n\nInitially, the passbook allowed users to view their current account balance and transaction history at any time. However, in the future, we plan to transition all users to online services and discontinue the issuance of passbooks.\n\n2. 用户想要查询交易流水或余额时，我们提供终端设备供用户登录查询。如果用户需要纸质版的交易流水，我们也提供打印服务。\n\nWhen users wish to check their transaction history or account balance, we provide terminals for them to log in and access the information. If users prefer a physical copy of their transaction history, we offer a printing service.\n\n# Exo Swap - New Icore for new user\n\n④Loan\n\n1. 贷款申请:当前app还不支持贷款功能，因此贷款功能需要新建纸件系统。用户线下填写资料，线下完成kyc审核并发放。Icore系统录入用户贷款借据数据\n\nLoan Application: The current app does not yet support loan functionality, so  new icore system is required for loan processing. Users will fill out information offline, complete KYC verification offline, and receive disbursement offline. The Icore system will input user loan promissory note data.\n\n2.还款申请：用户发起线下还款时，可以选择余额还款或者现金还款。同样完成还款操作后，记录在icore系统。\n\nRepayment Request: When users initiate offline repayments, they can choose either balance repayment or cash repayment. After completing the repayment process, the transaction details will be recorded in the Icore system.\n\n# Exo Swap - New Icore for new user\n\n④Pay Bills\n\n当前exo系统是否没有pay bills的模块，用户有pay bills的需求，可以优先引导用户在机器上面缴纳。\n\nThe current Exo system lacks a module for paying bills. If users have the need to pay bills, they can be prioritized and guided to make payments on the machine.\n\n⑤Qustions\n\n是否还有其他业务没有考虑到，后续所有的新增的线下用户和他们需要办理的业务，都按照上面我们规定进行。同时exo不会再有新增数据\n\nAre there any other business aspects that have not been taken into consideration. All subsequent new offline users and the services they need to process will follow the regulations we specified above.At the same time, there will be no more new data added to Exo.\n\n# Exo Swap - Migration of Old User Data\n\n①Old User Data\n\n1. 新系统支持使用老帐号查询，当前还存在老用户（exo用户数据），因此我们需要迁移此部分数据。\n\nThe new system supports querying using old accounts, and there are still existing old users (Exo user data). Therefore, we need to migrate this portion of the data.\n\n2. exo老用户来现场网点，由于新icore下所有的用户都转移到App，我们会提供机器让用户录入手机号+OTP验证，生成app账号。针对原本exo的数据，我们会做合并数据处理。\n\nOld Exo users who visit our on-site branches can use a provided machine to input their phone number and undergo OTP verification to generate an app account. For the original Exo data, we will perform data merging and processing since all users have been transferred to the new Icore system under the app.\n\n3. 问题点：\n\n① 活期、定期、贷款的迁移方案？\n\n② 历史交易流水是否需要迁移？或者根据快照数据迁移即可？\n\nIssue points:\n\n① Migration plans for current accounts, fixed-term deposits, and loans?\n\n② Is the migration of historical transaction records necessary, or can it be done based on snapshot data?\n\n# Exo Swap - Migration of Old User Data\n\n②Icore Data Upload\n\n报表功能未开发完成时，仍需依赖exo系统中的jasper报表能力。\n\nWhen the reporting function is not yet fully developed, we still need to rely on the Jasper reporting capabilities within the Exo system.\n\n# EXO二期方案说明\n\n# 1：历史用户迁移\n\n# 2：柜台运营方案\n\n# 3：数据上报方案\n\n# 柜台运营方案\n\n# 1：柜台账户服务\n\n# 2：柜台存，取\n\n# 3：柜台贷款业务\n\n# 4：柜台缴纳账单服务\n\n# SOP for Account openning \n\n①Account openning\n\n1. 如果线下用户过来开户，我们优先引导用户下载own bank app. 自己完成开户操作。\n\n准备工作\n\n1：准备二维码、注册操作手册\n\n2：提供免费WIFI\n\n3：建立开户（找回）失败处理流程SOP–大堂人员培训\n\n4：建立异常特殊情况处理沟通群\n\n5:  若没有智能机可注册，二期告知用户无法开户即可，后续可根据实际情况是否提供专用设备或者自动机\n\n6：发短信或者客服联系用户升级账户（本质就是在app上开户）\n\n# SOP for Deposit\n\n存款说明\n\n1：个人用户来网点办理存款业务，大堂人员先咨询是否注册过APP，若没注册，先引导用户注册，若已注册，则引导填写存款单\n\n2：已注册用户来办理存款，柜台人员根据存款单信息，在现金管理平台上操作存款\n\n# SOP for Withdraw&amp;Transfer\n\n存折用户取现：说服客户一次性提取完成，并重新开户，然后办理线上账户存款\n\n线上用户提现：按照现有的流程不变\n\n# SOP for Loans\n\n现状：当前APP不支持贷款功能\n\n贷款：不开放新增贷款功能\n\n还款\n\n用户前往柜台办理还款\n\n现金还款：在EXO系统处理还款\n\nAPP账户还款：\n\n现金管理系统处理支取，用途：还款\n\nEXO系统记录还款数据\n\n# SOP for Passbook users\n\n待补充\n\n# SOP for 柜台用户流水打印服务\n\n待补充\n\n# 数据处理方案\n\n# 1：个人数据迁移\n\n# 2：企业数据迁移\n\n# \n\n# Migration of Old User Data\n\n随着新Counter系统的上线，二期主要任务就是迁移原exo系统的数据至New Counter\n\n当前将此部分的数据分为3部分进行讨论\n\n① 用户/交易数据迁移\n\n② 贷款账户数据迁移\n\n③ 存款账户数据迁移\n\nWith the launch of the new Counter system, the main task of Phase Two is to migrate the data from the original exo system to the New Counter.\n\nCurrently, this data migration process is divided into three parts for discussion:\n\n① Migration of user/transaction data\n\n② Migration of loan account data\n\n③ Migration of deposit account data\n\n# Migration of user/transaction data\n\n ①存量用户账户数据迁移（开户身份信息数据）\n\n技术方案：\n\n不迁移原exo系统的数据，exo继续保留数据以便监管查询\n\n网点对客方案：\n\n1. 无存款用户：引导APP开户即可，数据不迁移，数据已上报过，无需迁移\n2. 有存款的用户【见存量个人用户活期账户+定期账户迁移】\n\n② 存量用户交易数据迁移\n\n技术方案：\n\n不迁移原exo系统的数据，数据合并上报\n\n网点对客方案：\n\nexo系统需要继续保留使用，基于数据保存的监管要求\n\nExisting user data migration\n\nTechnical solution:\n\nDo not migrate data from the original exo system; the exo system continues to retain data for regulatory queries.\n\nBranch-to-customer solution:\n\n1. For users without deposits, it is suggested to upgrade their accounts on-site (essentially prompting users to download the app and complete the account opening process).\n2. For users with deposits, the solution will be further discussed during the migration of deposit account data.\n\nExisting user data migration\n\nTechnical solution:\n\nDo not migrate data from the original exo system.\n\nBranch-to-customer solution:\n\nThe exo system needs to continue to be retained and used, based on regulatory requirements for data retention.\n\n# Migration of deposit account data\n\n ①存量个人用户活期账户+定期账户迁移\n\n数据处理：存量数据通过数据上报合并的方式处理\n\n网点对客方案：\n\n1. 大前提：需要停止新增的网点用户和存款数据，任何有开户或存款的需求都引导走线上app的流程。\n2. 柜台人员可以将原exo系统用户账户的余额迁移到Icore 中的新账户。\n3. 定期账户允许用户提前支取，并且补充应有的利息+印花税。定期账户的余额迁移至新用户的账户中，若用户不支取，则不处理账户迁移\n\n用户拿着存折过来存取款时，引导用户只能升级账户才能进行后续银行业务了。\n\n流程见【线下存款流程】\n\n待讨论点\n\n1：.柜台系统新增功能：柜员核对完用户信息后可以一键操作将exo中的余额切换到Icore中的账户，并将原exo中的账户做注销操作。--此部分牵涉到功能开发是否需要支持？\n\n2.柜台系统支持通过原exo的账户或手机号查询到账户。-此部分依赖数据是否迁移，若不迁移，则不用考虑\n\nMigration of Existing Individual Users' Savings and TD Accounts\n\nBranch-Customer Solution:\n\n1. Key Premise: It is necessary to stop adding new branch users and deposit data. Any requests for account opening or deposit should be directed to the online app process. Users can be incentivized with benefits such as higher deposit interest rates online. If users do not have mobile devices, branches can provide a device for account opening and deposit.\n2. Operational Measures: Send SMS or contact users through customer service to upgrade their accounts (essentially opening accounts on the app).\n3. When users come to deposit or withdraw with a passbook, guide them to upgrade their accounts to proceed with further banking transactions.\n4. Counter staff can transfer the balance of the original EXO system user account to the new account in Icore.\n5. Term deposit accounts allow users to make early withdrawals, with the addition of due interest and stamp duty. The balance of term deposit accounts is migrated to the new user's account.\n6. Counter system new function: After verifying user information, counter staff can operate with one click to switch the balance from EXO to Icore accounts and cancel the original EXO accounts.\n7. Counter system supports querying accounts through the original EXO accounts or phone numbers.\n\nTechnical Proposal:\n\n# Migration of deposit account data\n\n②个人定期账户迁移\n\n数据处理：存量数据通过数据上报合并的方式处理\n\n网点对客方案：\n\n1、用户办理定期账户支取，先APP开户，已开户，旧账户资产迁移至现金管理系统\n\n2、不愿意迁移的用户，保留到EXO系统上\n\n引导策略\n\n1：之前承诺的利息不扣印花税给到用户。定期+利息的金额转到用户的活期账户（产品可提供表格供计算补偿利息和印花税）\n\n异常场景\n\n1：若用户不愿办理迁移，可不做账户资产迁移，保留在EXO系统，待用户来提取\n\nDiscussion Points:\n\nMigration of term deposit accounts: Users come to the counter to process term deposit migration, and the promised interest without deduction of stamp duty is given to users. The amount of term deposit plus interest is transferred to the user's current account (the product can provide a form for calculating compensatory interest and stamp duty).\n\nFor users who have not upgraded their accounts, because the user's money is in our branch, they will eventually come to the branch to upgrade their accounts. The counter system supports querying original user data.\n\n# Migration of deposit account data\n\n ②存量企业用户活期账户+定期账户迁移\n\n网点对客方案：\n\n1. 当前只有少量的企业账户有定期存款，统计了下只有3个。\n2. 这部分的定期存款可以到期之后让用户转到网银系统，当前网银系统的定期功能已经在设计阶段。\n\nMigration of Existing Corporate Users' Savings and TD Accounts\n\nBranch-Customer Solution:\n\nCurrently, there are only a few corporate accounts with term deposits, totaling only three.\n\nThese term deposits can be transferred to the online banking system after maturity. The term deposit functionality of the current online banking system is already in the design stage.\n\n# Migration of loan account data\n\n 存量贷款数据迁移\n\n技术方案：\n\n1.由于数据量不多了，不迁移数据了\n\n2.后续bsp报表合并这部分的数据（三期）\n\n网点对客方案：\n\n1. 依然需要保留还款功能，还款方案见【还款SOP】\n2. 在ownbank贷款产品上线前，贷款记录或还款记录依然需要在exo系统查询\n3. 3期的时候需要单独拉出此部分的数据，合并相关的报表（已整理当前所有借据数据，线下暂时没有新增的借据）\n4. 线下暂停贷款业务\n5. 当前已经逾期的借据如何处理\n6. 有些借据是否可以直接转成坏账（与柜台负责人和财务沟通）\n\n讨论点：\n\nLoan Account Data Migration\n\nTechnical Proposal:\n\n1. Due to the small volume of data, data migration will not be conducted.\n2. Subsequent BSP reports will consolidate this portion of the data (third quarter).\n3. The repayment functionality still needs to be retained.\n4. Before the OwnBank loan product goes live, loan records or repayment records still need to be queried in the EXO system.\n5. At the end of the third quarter, it will be necessary to separately extract this portion of the data and consolidate related reports (all current loan document data has been organized, and there are currently no new loan documents offline).\n6. How to handle currently overdue loan documents.\n7. Whether some loan documents can be directly converted to bad debts (communicate with the counter responsible person and finance).\n\nBranch-Customer Proposal:\n\nDiscussion Points:\n\n# Summary\n\n1. 我们不会在exo系统做任何业务办理（开户+存款），取款可以在exo系统完成\n\n但在2期阶段仍然需要上传csv文件。\n\n2. 需要确认个时间点，不能有新增的开户数据和存款数据了（但用户可以取款）\n\n3. Exo系统在未来一个阶段还是需要使用，因为监管报表\n\n1. We will not conduct any business transactions (account opening + deposits) in the Exo system, but withdrawals can still be completed in the Exo system. However, in Phase 2, uploading CSV files will still be required.\n2. We need to confirm a specific timeframe; no new account opening or deposit data should be added (but users can still make withdrawals).\n3. The Exo system will still be required for future use, primarily for regulatory reporting purposes.\n\n# 监管上报方案\n\n# 迁移方案\n\nbranch日常运营\n\n线下客户\n\nEXO-Jasper报表数据\n\nIcore\n\nBSP\n\n生成总账\n\n线上客户\n\nPDIC….\n\n各种财务报表等\n\n优点：\n\n（1）无需依赖exo\n\n（2）没有性能问题\n\n缺点：\n\n（1）需要花精力研究各种报表\n\n（2）周期会比较长\n\n（3）新系统上线需要平滑期\n\n自研报表\n\n# Thanks\n\n--- Extracted Images ---\n[IMAGE_REF: example/extracted_assets/Exo Swap_img_0.png]\n", "product_area": "exo swap", "extracted_images": ["example/extracted_assets/Exo Swap_img_0.png"]}

Both paths converge at \"Generate the list of bills.\"\n\nAfter the list is generated, the next steps are sequential:  \n- Set a billing reminder date.  \n- Send payment reminders when due.  \n- Make payment via Own Bank.  \n\nThe flow direction is primarily top-down with branching paths that merge before continuing linearly toward payment.\n\nActors: The primary actor is the user interacting with the OwnBank app. Secondary actors include external partner platforms for bill retrieval.\n\nDecision points: None explicitly shown—this is a process flow rather than a decision tree.\n\n4. **Summary**:  \nThis diagram outlines a streamlined process for managing and paying bills through the OwnBank platform. Users can either select existing bills, manually input new ones, or retrieve bills from partner services.

It outlines how user interactions from different access points flow through security, service layers, business logic, and core systems to support card-related operations.\n\n2. **Text Content**:  \n- **Access**:  \n  - In the bank: App, Counter, Online Banking  \n  - Outside the bank: ATM, Partners, Mall  \n\n- **API Layer**:  \n  - Security Control, Service Registration, API Governance, Authentication, Protocol Conversion  \n\n- **Self-developed business**:  \n  - User Modules: Card Account Management, Credit Line, Credit Application, Credit Adjustment  \n  - Trading Module: Consumption, Payments, Repayment  \n  - Card Module: Card Management, Transaction Management, Credit Management, Fee Management  \n  - Marketing Module: Points, Vouchers  \n  - Basic Services: SMS, Encryption, Logistics, Mail  \n  - Operation Center: Card Operations, Billing Operations, Customer Operations, Transaction Operations  \n  - Card Gateway: MC, VISA, JCB  \n  - Group Risk Control  \n\n- **Core ESB Gateway**  \n\n- **Card Core**:  \n  - Online:  \n    - Product Center: Basic Products, Sales Products, Installment products, Exclusive Products  \n    - Public Center: Interest Rate Factory, Internal Household, Integrated Business, Accounting Management  \n    - Accounts Center: Consumption, Cash withdrawal, Repayment, Accounts  \n    - Instalment Center: Staging Application, Instalment Change, Instalment Plan, Instalment Placement  \n    - Payment Center: Consumption, Cash withdrawal, Repayment, Promotional Spending  \n  - Batch: Billing, Late Interest, Installment Interest, Overpayment Interest  \n  - Payment Channels: Payment Central, Instapay, Pesonet  \n\n- **Data**:  \n  - Statement, Reconciliation, BSP  \n\n- **Data Platform**  \n\n3. **Visual Logic**:  \nThe diagram follows a top-down flow representing the interaction path from user access to backend data processing.  \n\n- **Flow Direction**: Top → Bottom  \n- **Actors**: Users accessing via App, Counter, Online Banking, ATM, Partners, or Mall.  \n- **Entry Points**: Access is divided into \"In the bank\" and \"Outside the bank\" channels. These connect to an API layer with controls like authentication and protocol conversion.  \n- **Processing Flow**:  \n  1. Requests from access channels go through the API layer.  \n  2. They then reach the **Self-developed business** layer, which includes functional modules like User, Trading, Card, Marketing, Basic Services, and Operation Center.  \n  3. The **Card Gateway** (MC, VISA, JCB) and **Group Risk Control** interact bidirectionally with the Card Module and Operation Center.  \n  4. All business logic routes through the **Core ESB Gateway**, acting as a central integration point.  \n  5. From there, requests are directed to the **Card Core**, split into Online and Batch processing.  \n     - Online handles real-time transactions across centers like Product, Public, Accounts, Instalment, and Payment.  \n     - Batch processes recurring tasks like billing and interest calculations.  \n     - Payment Channels (Payment Central, Instapay, Pesonet) interface with the Payment Center.  \n  6. Outputs include Statement, Reconciliation, and BSP, all feeding into the **Data Platform** at the bottom.  \n\n- **Decision Points**: Not explicitly marked; however, routing decisions occur implicitly at each layer based on transaction type (e.g., online vs. batch, payment vs. credit).  \n- **Interactions**: Bidirectional arrows between Card Gateway and business modules, and between Payment Channels and Payment Center indicate two-way communication.\n\n4. **Summary**:  \nThis diagram depicts a comprehensive card management system architecture in a financial institution. It shows how customer access through multiple channels (mobile apps, ATMs, etc.) is processed through layered systems—starting with API security and governance, moving through modular business functions, integrating via a core ESB gateway, and finally handling transactions in real-time (Online) or scheduled (Batch) modes within the Card Core. The system supports full lifecycle card operations including application, consumption, repayment, installment plans, and risk control, with data consolidated into a centralized Data Platform for reporting and reconciliation.", "product_area": "extracted_assets", "source_type": "image"}

This suggests lifecycle management of the provider.\n- **Step 2**: The \"provider\" registers itself with the \"registry\", allowing it to be discovered.\n- **Step 3**: The \"consumer\" subscribes to services in the \"registry\", expressing interest in available providers.\n- **Step 4**: The \"registry\" notifies the \"consumer\" when a service (e.g., provider) becomes available or changes state.\n- **Step 5**: The \"consumer\" invokes a method or service on the \"provider\".\n\nInternal structure:\n- The \"provider\" is composed of internal components: one \"boss\", one \"io\", and three \"worker\" threads/processes. These likely represent different roles in handling requests (e.g., boss for coordination, workers for task execution, io for input/output).\n- The \"consumer\" interacts with a \"file cache\", suggesting local caching of data or metadata (possibly service addresses or configurations).\n\nFlow Direction:\n- Arrows indicate the direction of communication:\n  - From \"publish system\" → \"provider\" (step 1)\n  - \"provider\" → \"registry\" (step 2)\n  - \"consumer\" → \"registry\" (step 3)\n  - \"registry\" → \"consumer\" (step 4)\n  - \"consumer\" → \"provider\" (step 5)\n\nDashed lines suggest indirect or asynchronous communication (subscription/notification), while solid red line indicates direct invocation.\n\nActors:\n- **publish system**: Manages the provider’s lifecycle.\n- **provider**: Offers services; contains internal sub-components.\n- **registry**: Centralized service discovery mechanism.\n- **consumer**: Requests services; uses local caching.\n- **file cache**: Local storage used by consumer.\n\nDecision points: None explicitly shown; this is a procedural flow rather than a decision tree.\n\n4. **Summary**:  \nThis diagram depicts a service discovery and invocation model where a provider registers with a registry upon startup, consumers subscribe to discover services, and the registry notifies consumers of availability. Once notified, the consumer invokes the provider directly. The provider is structured with multiple internal roles (boss, io, workers), and the consumer maintains a local file cache, likely for performance optimization.

The user starts by clicking \"Send Cash.\"\n2. The system requests contact info from the OwnBank System.\n3. If no contact is found, the user enters a frequent contacts page; otherwise, proceeds.\n4. The user enters send cash details and selects a receiving outlet.\n5. The user inputs an address, which triggers a real-time map data request to the OwnBank System.\n6. Matching data is returned, and the user matches the selected address.\n7. Coordinates are sent to retrieve nearby outlets.\n8. The OwnBank System calculates nearby outlet names and returns them to the user.\n9. The user selects an outlet and fills in recipient info, amount, etc.\n10. The system checks if funds are sufficient.\n    - If not, the process stops.\n    - If yes, the user confirms order info and enters a transaction PIN.\n11. A security verification is called.\n    - If verification fails, it loops back to re-enter PIN.\n    - If successful, an order is created.\n12. The OwnBank System waits for a reference number from the Payment Gateway.\n13. The Payment Gateway returns a reference number and notifies the Core System to freeze funds.\n14. The Core System freezes the fund.\n15. The reference number is forwarded to the user.\n16. The user proceeds to pick up cash at a Dragonpay outlet.\n17. Upon successful pickup, the Payment Gateway receives a notification and forwards it to the OwnBank System.\n18. The OwnBank System notifies the Core System to deduct the fund.\n19.

The flow direction is generally left to right for both paths, but diverges at step 6.\n\n- **Shared Steps (1–6)**:  \n  - Steps 1 through 6 apply to both digital and cash payments. These include setting targets, recording work, reporting to HR/accounting, verifying salary, and approval.  \n  - Step 6 (\"Salary is approved\") marks the divergence point.  \n\n- **Digital Path (Steps 7–8)**:  \n  - After approval, records are uploaded to the payroll bank (Step 7).  \n  - Then, salary is directly paid to the worker’s bank account (Step 8).  \n  - This path uses yellow icons and is marked as \"Digital\" in the legend.  \n\n- **Cash Path (Steps 7–11)**:  \n  - After approval, the process continues with a separate sequence:  \n    - Step 7 (Cash): Accounting team prepares cash vouchers.  \n    - Step 8 (Cash): Factory coordinates with bank to deliver exact change.  \n    - Step 9: Pick up cash from bank.  \n    - Step 10: Accounting team counts and organizes cash into envelopes.  \n    - Step 11: Cash is distributed to workers.  \n  - This path uses green icons and is labeled \"Cash.\"\n\n- **Actors Involved**:  \n  - Workers (implicit in recording time/output)  \n  - Accounting/HR team (verifies salary, prepares vouchers, uploads data)  \n  - Factory management (coordinates with bank)  \n  - Bank (handles cash delivery and digital transfers)  \n\n- **Decision Point**:  \n  - At Step 6, after salary approval, the process splits based on payment method—digital or cash.  \n\n- **Flow Direction**:  \n  - Main flow: Left to right for both paths.  \n  - Divergence occurs after Step 6, with the digital path proceeding to Step 7 (upload), and the cash path continuing with its own steps (7–11).  \n  - Note: Step numbers 7 and 8 are reused in both paths, indicating different activities under the same number.\n\n---\n\n**4. Summary**:  \nThis diagram compares the workflow and resource requirements for paying workers via digital bank transfers versus physical cash. Both methods begin identically with target setting, time/output tracking, and salary verification. After approval, digital payments involve uploading records to a payroll bank and direct deposit into workers’ accounts—a streamlined, low-resource process. In contrast, cash payments require additional steps: preparing vouchers, coordinating with the bank, picking up cash, organizing it into envelopes, and distributing it manually—requiring more personnel and time.

It displays details about a loan request including amount, repayment plan, and receiving account options.\n\n2. **Text Content**:  \n- Loan amount: ₱40,000  \n- Loan amount range: ₱500.00 - ₱40,000.00  \n- Disbursed amount: ₱39,600.00  \n- Admin fee (1%): ₱400.00  \n- Repayment plan:  \n  - First payment due: 12 Jul 2025  \n  - 9 payments: ₱6,244.48 (selected)  \n  - 12 payments: ₱4,933.39  \n- Receiving account:  \n  - Bank Account (with BPI and BDO logos visible)  \n  - E-wallets  \n- Checkbox text: \"I agree to the terms and conditions of the Loan agreement.\"  \n- Button: \"Exit full screen (f)\"  \n- Page header: \"Request loan\"\n\n3. **Visual Logic**:  \nThe interface presents a step in the loan application process where the user finalizes loan details before submission. The flow is sequential and user-driven:\n\n- The user selects a loan amount (₱40,000), which falls within the allowed range.\n- The system calculates the disbursed amount after deducting a 1% admin fee (₱400.00).\n- The user chooses a repayment plan:\n  - Two options are available: 9 payments at ₱6,244.48 each (selected) or 12 payments at ₱4,933.39 each.\n  - The first payment is due on 12 July 2025.\n- The user selects a receiving account:\n  - Options include bank accounts (BPI, BDO) and e-wallets.\n  - Each option has an \"Add\" button, suggesting users can add or select existing accounts.\n- At the bottom, there is a checkbox for agreeing to the loan terms and conditions, indicating a mandatory step before proceeding.\n- The \"Exit full screen (f)\" overlay suggests the screenshot was taken in full-screen mode.\n\nActors: User (applicant) and the financial platform (system).\n\nDecision points:\n- Selection of repayment plan (9 vs. 12 payments).\n- Choice of receiving account type (bank or e-wallet).\n- Agreement to terms and conditions.\n\nFlow direction: Top to bottom — from loan amount selection to repayment plan, then receiving account, and finally agreement confirmation.\n\n4. **Summary**:  \nThis interface allows a user to finalize a loan request for ₱40,000, with a ₱400.00 admin fee deducted, resulting in a disbursed amount of ₱39,600. The user selects between two repayment plans (9 or 12 installments) and specifies a receiving account (bank or e-wallet).

Each month, the customer pays a fixed total of IDR 181,550, which includes decreasing interest and increasing principal. The outstanding balance decreases each month until it reaches zero at the end of Month 6.\n\n- **Second Table (AL to Bank)**: Shows AL’s repayment to the bank for the same amount (IDR 1,000,000) but at a lower 15% annual interest rate. AL pays a fixed total of IDR 174,034 per month, with decreasing interest and increasing principal. This results in a smaller total repayment (IDR 1,044,203) compared to what the customer paid.\n\n- **Third Table (AL’s Profitability)**: Calculates AL’s income from the interest margin. Each month, AL earns interest income from the difference between the interest charged to the customer and paid to the bank. Additionally, there is a \"Principal Payment Difference\" that fluctuates due to differing amortization schedules. However, the \"Actual Cash Income\" remains constant at IDR 7,516 per month, totaling IDR 45,097 over six months.\n\n- **Flow Direction**:  \n  - Customer → AL (repayment at 30% interest)  \n  - AL → Bank (repayment at 15% interest)  \n  - AL earns the spread (interest margin) as profit.  \n  - Decision points are implicit in the monthly payment structure based on amortization formulas.\n\n4. **Summary**:  \nThis diagram models a loan channeling business model where AL acts as an intermediary between a customer and a bank. The customer borrows IDR 1,000,000 at 30% p.a., repaying IDR 181,550 monthly. AL borrows the same amount from the bank at 15% p.a., repaying IDR 174,034 monthly. AL profits from the 15% interest margin, generating a consistent cash income of IDR 7,516 per month, totaling IDR 45,097 over six months. The analysis highlights how AL benefits from the difference in interest rates while managing both repayment schedules.", "product_area": "extracted_assets", "source_type": "image"}

The steps are as follows:\n\n   - Step 1: The DNS is configured with a list of WAF IP addresses (1.1.1.1, 2.2.2.2, 3.3.3.3).\n   - Step 2: The application sends a domain name resolution request to DNS to find a WAF endpoint.\n   - Step 3: DNS returns one available IP address from the WAF list (e.g., 1.1.1.1, 2.2.2.2, or 3.3.3.3).\n   - Step 4: The application then sends an HTTPS request directly to the returned WAF instance IP.\n\n   **Actors**:  \n   - App: The client or application initiating the request.\n   - DNS: Responsible for resolving the domain and returning an available WAF IP.\n   - WAF Instances: Three backend WAF servers (1.1.1.1, 2.2.2.2, 3.3.3.3) that handle incoming traffic.\n\n   **Decision Point**:  \n   - The DNS server selects one available WAF IP from the list (implying load balancing or failover logic).\n\n   **Flow Direction**:  \n   - Starts at DNS → App → DNS → App → One of the WAF instances.  \n   - Arrows indicate the sequence of communication: DNS → App (step 2), App → DNS (step 3), App → WAF (step 4).\n\n4. **Summary**:  \nThis diagram depicts a DNS-based load-balancing mechanism for distributing HTTPS traffic from an application to multiple WAF instances. The DNS serves as a central resolver that maintains a list of available WAF IPs and returns one to the app upon request, enabling dynamic routing and redundancy. This setup allows for high availability and security by directing traffic through a WAF before reaching the actual application backend.", "product_area": "extracted_assets", "source_type": "image"}

It focuses on the high-level structure of business services, core systems, support functions, and data layers, excluding the underlying base technology platform.\n\n---\n\n**Text Content**:  \n- **Title**: \"business architecture\"  \n- **Caption**: \"this diagram show almost all the key business module of ownbank without the base technology platform\"  \n- **Top Layer Components**:  \n  - app  \n  - out financing institution  \n  - Internet  \n  - Intranet  \n- **API Layers**:  \n  - api-gateway  \n  - open-api  \n- **Bank System (Ali Cloud)**:  \n  - user-biz  \n  - account-biz  \n  - commons-biz  \n  - backend-console-biz  \n  - backend-user-biz  \n  - trade-biz  \n  - user-service  \n  - sso-service  \n  - commos-service  \n  - account-service  \n  - backend-user-service  \n  - backend-console-service  \n  - transfer-service  \n  - deposit-service  \n- **Core System (Huawei Cloud)**:  \n  - ESB  \n  - batch-assistant  \n  - ops  \n  - sump  \n  - PO  \n  - counter  \n  - marketing  \n  - payment  \n  - iCore(onlien/batch)  \n- **Support Modules**:  \n  - msg&push: sms-service, push-service  \n  - algorithm: face recognition, Vivo detection, OCR  \n  - risk ctr: risk-biz, rule engine, feature, audit, security  \n  - pay platform: pay-service, fund-service  \n- **Data Layer**:  \n  - Mysql, TDSQL, Redis, ES, MongoDB  \n- **Data Flow**:  \n  - data sync → data warehouse → reconciliation system  \n\n---\n\n**Visual Logic**:  \nThe diagram is structured in a hierarchical, layered fashion from top to bottom, showing how different components interact within the banking system’s business architecture:\n\n1. **External Interfaces (Top Layer)**:\n   - The `app` represents the client-facing application.\n   - External entities like `out financing institution`, `Internet`, and `Intranet` are shown as external access points.\n\n2. **API Gateways**:\n   - `api-gateway` and `open-api` serve as entry points for internal and external requests, respectively.\n\n3. **Business Modules (Bank System - Ali Cloud)**:\n   - Divided into two tiers:\n     - **Business Logic (biz)**: Handles high-level business functions (e.g., user management, trading).\n     - **Services (service)**: Implements specific operations such as user authentication (`sso-service`), transfers, deposits, etc.\n   - These modules are grouped under the “bank system ali cloud” domain.\n\n4. **Core Banking System (Huawei Cloud)**:\n   - Centralized core processing system labeled `iCore(onlien/batch)` with sub-components:\n     - Operational tools: `batch-assistant`, `ops`, `sump`, `PO`\n     - Core transaction functions: `counter`, `marketing`, `payment`\n   - Connected via an **ESB (Enterprise Service Bus)**, enabling message routing and integration between systems.\n\n5. **Support Systems**:\n   - **msg&push**: Messaging and notification services.\n   - **algorithm**: AI/ML capabilities including face recognition, fraud detection (\"Vivo detection\"), and OCR.\n   - **risk ctr**: Risk control functions including rule engines, auditing, and security.\n   - **pay platform**: Payment-related services like `pay-service` and `fund-service`.\n\n6. **Data Layer**:\n   - Multiple databases: Mysql, TDSQL, Redis, ES, MongoDB — representing diverse data storage needs.\n   - Data is synchronized via a `data sync` arrow to the **data warehouse**, which feeds into the **reconciliation system** for financial accuracy checks.\n\n7. **Flow Direction**:\n   - Requests flow from external sources (app, internet) through API gateways into business modules.\n   - Business logic interacts with the core system (iCore) via ESB.\n   - Support systems provide real-time or batch processing enhancements (e.g., risk checks, messaging).\n   - All data is eventually synced to the data warehouse and reconciliation system for reporting and compliance.\n\n8. **Actors**:\n   - Users (via app)\n   - Internal systems (core banking, support services)\n   - External institutions (financing partners)\n\n9. **Decision Points**:\n   - Not explicitly marked, but implied in:\n     - Risk control (rule engine, audit)\n     - Algorithmic decisions (face recognition, fraud detection)\n     - Payment authorization flows\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nThis business architecture diagram depicts the modular design of OwnBank’s digital banking platform, emphasizing separation of concerns across business logic, core processing, support services, and data infrastructure. It highlights integration between cloud-based systems (Ali Cloud and Huawei Cloud), use of microservices and ESB for interoperability, and robust support for security, risk management, and data synchronization. The system supports online and batch operations, real-time transactions, customer interactions, and regulatory compliance through centralized data warehousing and reconciliation.", "product_area": "extracted_assets", "source_type": "image"}
